# Manga2Anime-Generative-Transition

This is a fun personal project to create a seamless transition from an existing comic (manga, manhwa, DC/Marvel comic) page to the exact sequence in its animation adaptation, with the in-between frame sequence generated at runtime or cached using a Write-Ahead Log (WAL).

Target:
Swap from the Reader Web App ➝ to a Player App (any with time-tag support).
The player app is responsible for preloading the episode and playing from a specified timestamp.
Currently, both the player and reader are combined into a single simple web app.

Current Transition Generation:
PIL image blending: Generates 16 frames

Generative Stable Diffusion: Uses from–to encoding/decoding with loss
Supports 1-second transitions

Future Prospects:
Attach a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model for dynamic mapping between comic content and animation frame hotspots

Enable runtime transition generation using:

Stable Diffusion (for quality)

WebGL (for performance on supported devices)
